<div class="textblock"><p>Open Network Switch Layer (OpenNSL) is a library of network switch APIs that is openly available for programming Broadcom network switch silicon based platforms. These open APIs enable development of networking application software based on Broadcom network switch architecture based platforms. Because of the wide variety of switch devices the OpenNSL APIs run on, not all functions are available on all underlying devices. The API exports silicon features in an independent manner as much as possible, but does not implement in software those functions that the underlying devices do not support.</p>
<p>From the OpenNSL point of view, the system is a collection of interconnected devices, each controlling ports. Operations are carried out on a particular device and ports on that device are often specified as a bitmap. After devices, the most important object is the port. This is illustrated by the fact that the OpenNSL Port API is the largest set of functions by far. The OpenNSL API uses small integers to refer to ports. These are generally the physical port numbers on the device. Thus, it is necessary to know the particulars of the device being updated to address the ports on that device.</p>
<p>OpenNSL software contains the files needed for development of switch applications: C header files, libraries and documentation.</p>

OpenNSL Software Architecture</h1>
<p>This section describes fundamental concepts needed for understanding the OpenNSL API calls. It describes the basic types and function calls for manuipulating those types. Figure 1 is a block diagram representation of the various components of OpenNSL.</p>

<p> The following is a list of fundamental aspects of switching which are all managed by the OpenNSL API.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Layer 2</b>: Switch devices in the system generally inspect the Layer 2 header of a packet, possibly learn the source address and switch the packet based on the destination address. Managing the Layer 2 forwarding data base is an important part of the software.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Layer 3</b>: Some devices support examining deeper into the packet to determine the Layer 3 characteristics of the packet, updating the packet and forwarding the packet based on this information. Typically, software is responsible for the learning of Layer 3 routes, but there-after, hardware may be able to forward these packets without software intervention.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>VLAN</b>: A virtual network to which ports may belong. Ports may maintain state which is VLAN specific. A port may belong to multiple VLANs.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>STG</b>: Spanning tree groups are groups of VLANs. A port has a forwarding state for each spanning tree group and this is the state used for each VLAN in that group.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Statistics</b>: The Statistics module allows for retrieval of common SNMP statistics for use with switch management and diagnostics software. Both 64-bit and 32-bit counters are supported. The statistics API uses an enumerated type indicating the type of statistics to retrieve. </li>
</ul>
